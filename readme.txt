Description + Credits:
Legendary Dark Knights is a brand new campaign coded by myself and Dr. Penguin, with assistance from DeepDarkKapustka. The logo was made by Alan 3D.

Features:
The mod adjusts the encounters of every mission on the son of sparda difficulty (now renamed to legendary dark knights). It does not adjust the post credit sequences, secret missions or bloody palace. In addition, mission 6, 17,19 & 20 are unaltered, as they are just bossfights.

This mod works when playing in coop with Dante & Nero, or with V solo. Playing with V and other players in coop currently runs the risk of causing crashes, though doing so possible.

To play in coop, both you and your coop partner must BOTH have the LDK mod installed, have the Co-op trainer running, and have the LDK Trainer active.
